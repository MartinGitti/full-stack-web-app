# MERN Fullstack Web Application
## Part 1- Planning of Web Application.

### Software requirements:

#### System Architecture
#### The 'MERN' stack will be used for the development of this Web Application.

> I will be using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js to create a Fullstack Web Application.
* MongoDB-> Database,
* Express-> Backend,
* React-> Frontend,
* Node.js-> Backend.

##### Front-end

* React will be used as the user interface which is what the users of the app will see and interact with.
* The React App will be able to be viewed from any device that supports the usage of a browser.
* The React App will can be accessed via a URL, if loaded will render and display all the content available to the user to interact with.
* CSS will be user to style the Web Apllication, hold the users attention by providing an attractive interface.
* The client(frontend) will be created using create-react-app(React) as the ReactJS framework.
* Within the React app, I'll be using Javascript, HTML & CSS.
* The React app will act as the user interface and offer the user experience.

##### Database
* MongoDB will serve as the database which is where all user information and data will be stored, accessed and munipulated.
* the database will be used to check if any users are already registered on the system, it is used for login purposes and athentication.
* All user information is confidential and will be saved securely within the database eg. passwords.
* The database will also store data between sessions so that it can be accessed by the user at different times.

##### Back-end
* All back-end code will be written using Node.js & Express.js.
* The back-end server will act as a link which will communicate information between React(front-end) and the MongoDB(database).
* The back-end server will provide HTML pages to the user's device & accept HTTP requests from the user, responding to user requests accordingly.
* The back-end of the the Web app will store all logic and fuctionality to offer the user a smooth and enjoyable experience. 
  The back-end server will do all the heavy duty behind the scenes.
* Node.js will offer speed & efficiency to the developement environment.

##### Basic pre-requesites for the development of the App:

* Node.js(Back-end server)
* npm registry(Back-end)-> Will be used to install all necessary dependancies, packages & other required files.
* Text Editor(Used to write all code)-> I'll be using Visual Studio Code as my preferred text editor.
* Postman || Insomnia (These will be used to test all HTTP requests.)
